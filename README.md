ToDo List App
Created a full-stack task management application that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks. The application is built with a focus on user-friendly interfaces, 
smooth interactions, and robust back-end functionality. Below is a comprehensive overview of the project. Here is the complete overview of the project:
FRONT-END
1) TASK-CREATION FORM
   -> Title
   -> Description
   -> Status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done")
   -> Form validation ensures that tasks cannot be created without a title.
2) Task List
   -> Displays a list of tasks with the ability to:
   -> Update the status
   -> Delete a task
   -> Provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
3) Task Filtering
   -> Includes a filter or dropdown to filter tasks by status:
      "All"
      "To Do"
      "In Progress"
      "Done"
4) Responsive Design
   -> Ensures a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
